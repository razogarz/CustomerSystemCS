<h1> CustomerSystemCS </h1>
<p> Customer System for Esatto, made in C# .net core <br />
HOW TO RUN:
The app can be run from Terminal from the 'CustomerSystemCS/.' directory, using 'dotnet run' (I've used version 7.0.201, anything above 7.0 should work correctly) </p>

<h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">STEPS </h2>
<ol>
<li> Open the Terminal </li>
<li> Go to the project directory, more specifically '<your path>/CustomerSystemCS/.' </li>
<li> Type 'dotnet run', if you've successfully installed and configured dotnet </li>
</ol>
It's a console application and it should run in a few seconds time.
